# Anna Christ :books:

## Description

---

This website was the first commissioned work I uploaded and also built from scratch and let me made my first experience with actually deploying something.

It's a simplistic static fully responsive website for my friend Anna who is a screenwriter / documentary filmmmaker from Berlin.

It basically works as a portfolio of her work supported by a language choice and two sliders.

The goal was to land an agency for her and it worked! So everyone's happy now! :smile:

## Additional Infos / Thoughts

As I evolved my skills after this project I would certainly clean up a little.

For instance I would no longer make a hard redirect from the index file to a separate language folder as well as handle the integration of JavaScript files with modules.

As this is most certainly no masterpiece I'm still proud of how this first website turned out. It's simple and does everything the way it should, meaning it does not always need a fancy framework just to build out a nice portfolio :wink:
